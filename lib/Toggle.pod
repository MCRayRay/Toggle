Toggle - Feature toggles (a.k.a. flippers, flags, switches etc.)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Redis;
    use Toggle;
    
    # This probably happens once for your application, e.g. via Bread::Board
    my $redis = Redis->new;
    my $toggle = Toggle->new( storage => $redis );
    
    # Define any groups you might need - your sub will be passed the $user
    # object that you send to is_active(), and should return true/false.
    $toggle->define_group( staff => sub {
        my $user = shift;
        return $user->has_role('staff');
    });
    
    ...
    
    # In your controllers
    
    # $user has an ->id accessor
    if ( $toggle->is_active(chat => $user) ) {
        # Show this user the shiny new chat feature
    }
    
    ...
    
    # Elsewhere, in a management UI tool
    $toggle->add_user( chat => $bob );      # Turn it on for Bob
    $toggle->add_group( chat => 'staff' );  # Enable staff testing
    $toggle->add_percentage( chat => 10 );  # 10% rollout
